# Food-demand-forecasting
As in today’s competitive life even the business has become more difficult. Demand for food is increasing day by day with the increase in the population of every country. Estimation of the demand in food consumption plays a vital role in supplying or generating resources to produce the required amount of food. To meet this challenge, we need to predict the demand in food consumption for future so that the hunger of everyone can be satisfied. We will analyse all the previous year’s data on how the food demand has been throughout the restaurants. 
The major task that one would face in this will be predicting the quantity of products to be bought and prepared. It is very difficult to predict the number of orders in a given restaurant on a given day. A wrong prediction may end up purchasing and preparing less amount of food which will cause shortage or purchasing and preparing more which will lead to wastage of food. So, predicting the exact demand is a challenge because of uncertainty and fluctuations in consumer demand.
